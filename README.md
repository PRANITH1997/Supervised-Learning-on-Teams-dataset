## Overview

Predicting team performance is a valuable task in various contexts, from sports analytics to business management. This project demonstrates how to leverage the Decision Tree algorithm for machine learning to predict team performance based on input features.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: The primary programming language used for data analysis, machine learning, and scripting.
- **Pandas**: A versatile data manipulation library for cleaning, transforming, and analyzing data.
- **Scikit-learn**: A machine learning library that provides tools for predictive data analysis, including the Decision Tree algorithm.
- **Matplotlib**: A powerful visualization library for creating static, interactive, and dynamic visualizations.
- **Seaborn**: A high-level interface to Matplotlib for creating informative and attractive statistical graphics.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project contains various features related to teams, such as team composition, historical performance, and training data. The data is available in a CSV format and can be accessed in the `data` directory.
